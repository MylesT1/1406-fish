<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Pluses: </b>For the site; our layout and design, usability (mobile view compatible), easy navigation, and the amount &amp; location of our pictures. For the teamwork/work process; everybody worked together, we were coordinated and had no arguments.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Minuses: </b> None that we can think of... &nbsp; :D</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Interesting: </b>During the peer reviewing session with other groups, we found some
flaws in our code and some typos which we surprisingly never saw before hehe. Also, learning to make calculations (which includes mixing the types of fishes) through javascript (which made our Order Page unique from others'). Concludingly, we've learned a lot from this assignment. We learned that github is a very helpful platform when working with others in any code related project. And finally that coding is simple if one is patient and dedicated enough to learn and code.</span></p>
